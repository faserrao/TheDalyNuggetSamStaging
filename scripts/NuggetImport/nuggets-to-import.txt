Barbecue may not be the road to world peace, but it’s a start.%Anthony Bourdain%Food
But I do think the idea that basic cooking skills are a virtue, that the ability to feed yourself and a few others with proficiency should be taught to every young man and woman as a fundamental skill, should become as vital to growing up as learning to wipe one’s own ass, cross the street by oneself, or be trusted with money.%Anthony Bourdain%Food
But I'm simply not going to deceive anybody about the life as I've seen it. It's all here: the good, the bad and the ugly.%Anthony Bourdain%Life
Do we really want to travel in hermetically sealed popemobiles through the rural provinces of France, Mexico and the Far East, eating only in Hard Rock Cafes and McDonald's? Or do we want to eat without fear, tearing into the local stew, the humble taqueria's mystery meat, the sincerely offered gift of a lightly grilled fish head?%Anthony Bourdain%Travel
Drink heavily with locals whenever possible.%Anthony Bourdain%Travel
Food is everything we are. It's an extension of nationalist feeling, ethnic feeling, your personal history, your province, your region, your tribe, your grandma. It's inseparable from those from the get-go.%Anthony Bourdain%Food

I’m a big believer in winging it. I’m a big believer that you’re never going to find perfect city travel experience or the perfect meal without a constant willingness to experience a bad one. Letting the happy accident happen is what a lot of vacation itineraries miss, I think, and I’m always trying to push people to allow those things to happen rather than stick to some rigid itinerary.%Anthony Bourdain%Travel

If you’re a writer, particularly if you’re a writer or a storyteller of any kind, there is something already kind of monstrously wrong with you.%Anthony Bourdain%Life
If you’re twenty-two, physically fit, hungry to learn and be better, I urge you to travel – as far and as widely as possible. Sleep on floors if you have to. Find out how other people live and eat and cook. Learn from them — wherever you go.%Anthony Bourdain%Travel
It seems that the more places I see and experience, the bigger I realize the world to be. The more I become aware of, the more I realize how relatively little I know of it, how many places I have still to go, how much more there is to learn.%Anthony Bourdain%Travel
It’s an irritating reality that many places and events defy description. Angkor Wat and Machu Picchu, for instance, seem to demand silence, like a love affair you can never talk about. For a while after, you fumble for words, trying vainly to assemble a private narrative, an explanation, a comfortable way to frame where you’ve been and what’s happened. In the end, you’re just happy you were there — with your eyes open — and lived to see it.%Anthony Bourdain%Travel
Luck is not a business model.%Anthony Bourdain%Life
Meals make the society, hold the fabric together in lots of ways that were charming and interesting and intoxicating to me. The perfect meal, or the best meals, occur in a context that frequently has very little to do with the food itself.%Anthony Bourdain%Food

Travel changes you. As you move through this life and this world you change things slightly, you leave marks behind, however small. And in return, life — and travel — leaves marks on you.%Anthony Bourdain%Travel
Travel is about the gorgeous feeling of teetering in the unknown.%Anthony Bourdain%Travel
Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.%Anthony Bourdain%Travel
What are our expectations? Which of the things we desire are within reach? If not now, when? And will there be some left for me?%Anthony Bourdain%Life
Without new ideas, success can become stale.%Anthony Bourdain%Life
You can dress brunch up with all the focaccia, smoked salmon, and caviar in the world, but it’s still breakfast.%Anthony Bourdain%Food

"Vulnerability is the essence of romance.

Having the basics—a good bed to sleep in, good relationships, good food, and good sex—is most important, and those things don’t get much better when you have a lot of money or much worse when you have less.

I also feared boredom and mediocrity much more than I feared failure. For me, great is better than terrible, and terrible is better than mediocre, because terrible at least gives life flavor.

Thoughtful disagreement is not a battle; its goal is not to convince the other party that he or she is wrong and you are right, but to find out what is true and what to do about it.%Ray Dalio%Life
Time is like a river that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. We can’t stop our movement down this river and we can’t avoid those encounters. We can only approach them in the best possible way.%Ray Dalio%Life
To be effective you must not let your need to be right be more important than your need to find out what’s true. If you are too proud of what you know or of how good you are at something you will learn less, make inferior decisions, and fall short of your potential.%Ray Dalio%Life
Truth - more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality - is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes.%Ray Dalio%Life
